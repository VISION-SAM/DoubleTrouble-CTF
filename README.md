# Double Trouble CTF Solution

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Double Trouble" Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge from Vulnhub. This repository contains a step-by-step solution to the challenge, outlining the techniques and tools used to successfully complete it. You can access the challenge here: [Double Trouble - Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/doubletrouble-1,743/).

## Getting Started
To perform the CTF, you need to download and set up the "Double Trouble" virtual machine from Vulnhub. It can be run on various virtualization software like VMware or VirtualBox. Ensure you have one of these installed on your system to proceed with the challenge.

## Tools Used
In this repository, you will find detailed explanations of the tools and techniques I used to solve the challenge, including:
- **Nmap** for network scanning and port enumeration.
- **Netdiscover** for discovering network devices.
- **Dirb** for web directory scanning.
- **Stegcracker** and **Stegseek** for steganography analysis.

## Solution Overview
This repository is structured to help you navigate the CTF challenge:
1. **Enumeration**: Using Nmap and Netdiscover to identify open ports and running services.
2. **Exploitation**: Techniques to exploit identified vulnerabilities, such as directory traversal.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Methods to gain higher-level access on the machine.
4. **Flag Collection**: Instructions on where to find and how to capture the flags.
